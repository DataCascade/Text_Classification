# Text_Classification
Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand product description characteristics across Electronics, Household, Books, and Clothing & Accessories categories. Implemented text normalization techniques like lowercasing and contraction handling to ensure uniform data quality. Utilized TF-IDF vectorization to transform preprocessed descriptions into numerical vectors for machine learning algorithms. Established baseline model performance through evaluation of various classifiers on TF-IDF transformed data. Explored alternative approach with Word2Vec embedding and specific text normalization methods for semantic relationship capture. Compared classifier performance on Word2Vec embeddings and optimized hyperparameters of XGBoost classifier for improved predictive performance. Evaluated trained models on separate test dataset, achieving commendable test accuracy of 94.89% with selected model. Developed a robust classification model for e-commerce product categorization, showcasing machine learning efficacy in real-world challenges.
